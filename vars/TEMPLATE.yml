#   Download URL:       https://neatstuff.com/downloads/coolwidget-1.0.5.tar.gz

#app_to_compile: coolwidget     #This variable does NOT belong here, but should instead be defined at the top level (main playbook, group_vars, or host_vars)
                                # It will get passed down to the role when the role is called
